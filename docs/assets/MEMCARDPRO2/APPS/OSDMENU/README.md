# OSDMenu

Patches for OSDSYS and HDD OSD (Browser 2.0) based on Free McBoot 1.8.  

## Usage

### OSDMenu
1. Copy `osdmenu.elf` to `mc?:/BOOT/`  
   Copy DKWDRV to `mc?:/BOOT/DKWDRV.ELF` _(optional)_ 
2. Edit `mc?:/SYS-CONF/OSDMENU.CNF` [as you see fit](#osdmenucnf)
3. Configure PS2BBL to launch `mc?:/BOOT/osdmenu.elf` or launch it manually from anywhere

### HOSDMenu — OSDMenu for HDD OSD
1. Install HDD OSD 1.10U  
   Make sure HDD OSD binaries are installed into `hdd0:__system/osd100/` and `OSDSYS_A.XLF` is present.  
   SHA-256 hashes of `OSDSYS_A.XLF` known to work:
   - `acc905233f79678b9d7c1de99b0aee2409136197d13e7d78bf8978cd85b736ae` — original binary from the official HDD Utility Disc Version 1.10
   - `65360a6c210b36def924770f23d5565382b5fa4519ef0bb8ddf5c556531eec14` — cracked HDD OSD with 48-bit LBA support from the Sony Utility Disc Compilation 4 disc

   When using the unmodified binary on non-NTSC-U consoles, you will have to decrypt and re-encrypt the original binary with [`kelftool`](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/kelftool)
   to change the MagicGate region to 0xff (region free).
2. Copy `hosdmenu.elf` to `hdd0:__system/osdmenu/`  
   Copy DKWDRV to `hdd0:__system/osdmenu/DKWDRV.ELF` _(optional)_ 
3. Edit `hdd0:__sysconf/OSDMENU/OSDMENU.CNF` [as you see fit](#osdmenucnf)
4. Configure your bootloader to launch `hdd0:__system/osdmenu/hosdmenu.elf` or launch it manually from anywhere  
   You can also install HOSDMenu as `__mbr` payload to get quicker boot times, see [installer](utils/installer/README.md) for details.  

## Key differences from FMCB 1.8:
- All initialization code is removed in favor of using a separate bootloader to start the patcher (e.g. [PS2BBL](https://github.com/israpps/PlayStation2-Basic-BootLoader))
- USB support is dropped from the patcher, so only memory cards are checked for `OSDMENU.CNF`
- No ESR support
- No support for launching ELFs by holding a gamepad button
- ELF paths are not checked by the patcher, so every named entry from FMCB config file is displayed in hacked OSDSYS menu
- A separate launcher is used to launch menu entries
- CD/DVD support was extended to support skipping PS2LOGO, mounting VMCs on MMCE devices, showing visual GameID for PixelFX devices and booting DKWDRV for PS1 discs
- "Unlimited" number of paths for each entry
- Support for 1080i and 480p (as line-doubled 240p) video modes
- Support for "protokernel" systems (SCPH-10000, SCPH-15000) ported from Free McBoot 1.9 by reverse-engineering
- Support for launching applications from the memory card browser
- Support for setting PS1 driver options on every boot
- Support for HDD OSD 1.10U

Due to memory limitations and the need to support more devices, the original FMCB launcher was split into two parts: patcher and launcher.

## Patcher

This is a slimmed-down and refactored version of OSDSYS patches from FMCB 1.8 for modern PS2SDK with some new patches sprinkled in.
It patches the OSDSYS/HDD OSD binary and applies the following patches:
- Custom OSDSYS menu with up to 250 entries
- Infinite scrolling
- Custom button prompts and menu header
- Automatic disc launch bypass
- Force GS video mode to PAL, NTSC, 1080i or line-doubled 480p (with half the vertical resolution).  
  _Due to how to OSDSYS renders everything, "true" 480p can't be implemented easily_
- HDD update check bypass
- Override PS1 and PS2 disc launch functions with custom code that starts the launcher
- Additional system information in version submenu (Video mode, ROM version, EE, GS and MechaCon revision)  
- Set PS1 driver options to values from `OSDMENU.CNF` on every boot

**OSDMenu**:
- Launch SAS-compatible applications from the memory card browser if `title.cfg` exists in the directory (see [config handler](#config-handler))  
  This patch swaps around the "Enter" and "Options" menus and substitutes file properties submenu with the launcher.  
  To launch an app, just press "Enter" after selecting the app icon.  
  To copy or delete the save file, just use the triangle button.  

**HOSDMenu**:
- Boot custom payload when the Cross button is pressed during the initialization (see [here](#running-as-__mbr)).  
- Launch SAS-compatible applications and ELF files from directories in the `hdd0:__common` partition or the memory card browser
  if directory name is `BOOT`, `<3-letter SAS prefix>_<appname>` or if file name ends with `.ELF` or `.elf`.  
  To launch an app, just press "Enter" after selecting the app icon.
- ATAD driver is replaced to bypass security checks on unmodified HDD OSD or to fix compatibility with drives larger than 1TB on cracked HDD OSD.  
    
  Note that HDD OSD will not see more than 1048448 MB. For larger drives, [APA Jail](https://www.psx-place.com/threads/apa-jail.34847/) is recommended.  
  You can also check out [PSBBN Definitive English Patch](https://github.com/CosmicScale/PSBBN-Definitive-English-Patch) for more automated APA Jail experience and easy-to-use HDD OSD+Broadband Navigator setup.

Patches not supported/limited on protokernel systems:
- Automatic disc launch bypass
- Button prompt customization
- PAL video mode

**OSDMenu** version of the patcher reads settings from `mc?:/SYS-CONF/OSDMENU.CNF` and patches the `rom0:OSDSYS` binary.  
**HOSDMenu** version reads settings from `hdd0:__sysconf/OSDMENU/OSDMENU.CNF` and patches the `hdd0:__system/osd100/OSDSYS_A.XLF`

### Configuration

See the list for supported `OSDMENU.CNF` options [here](#osdmenucnf).  
OSDMenu will run the embedded launcher and pass the menu index to it for every menu item and disc launch.

### Running as `__mbr`

**HOSDMenu** supports [running from `__mbr`](utils/installer/README.md) on your hard drive, making the boot process essentially seamless.

It can also run a custom payload from `hdd0:__system` if `path_custom_payload` is set and the Cross button is held during HOSDMenu initialization. The valid path formats for `path_custom_payload` are:
- `hdd0:__system/<path to payload on __system>`
- `hdd0:__system:pfs:<path to payload on __system>`

If `boot_custom_payload` is enabled, the custom payload will be launched by default.
To load HDD OSD with this option enabled, simply hold the Cross button.

To improve reliability and avoid potential boot loops when neither HDD OSD nor the custom payload exist, HOSDMenu will attempt to run `RECOVERY.ELF` from USB.

## Launcher

A fully-featured main ELF launcher that handles launching ELFs and CD/DVD discs.  
Supports passing arbitrary arguments to an ELF and can also be used standalone.

Supported paths are:
- `mmce?:` — MMCE devices. Can be `mmce0`, `mmce1` or `mmce?`
- `mc?:` — Memory Cards. Can be `mc0`, `mc1` or `mc?`
- `mass:` and `usb:` — USB devices (supported via BDM)
- `ata:` — internal exFAT-formatted HDD (supported via BDM)
- `mx4sio:` — MX4SIO (supported via BDM)
- `ilink:` — i.Link mass storage (supported via BDM)
- `udpbd:` — UDPBD (supported via BDM)
- `hdd0:` — internal APA-formatted HDD
- `cdrom` — CD/DVD discs
- `fmcb` — special path for the patcher

Device support can be enabled and disabled by changing build-time configuration options (see [Makefile](launcher/Makefile))

### `udpbd` handler

Reads PS2 IP address from `mc?:/SYS-CONF/IPCONFIG.DAT`

### `cdrom` handler

Waits for the disc to be detected and launches it.
Supports the following arguments:
- `-nologo` — launches the game executable directly, bypassing `rom0:PS2LOGO`
- `-nogameid` — disables visual game ID
- `-dkwdrv` — when PS1 disc is detected, launches DKWDRV from `mc?:/BOOT/DKWDRV.ELF` instead of `rom0:PS1DRV`
- `-dkwdrv=<path to DKWDRV>` — same as `-dkwdrv`, but with custom DKWDRV path
- `-ps1fast` — will force fast disc speed for PS1 discs when not using DKWDRV
- `-ps1smooth` — will force texture smoothing for PS1 discs when not using DKWDRV

For PS1 CDs with generic executable name (e.g. `PSX.EXE`), attempts to guess the game ID using the volume creation date
stored in the Primary Volume Descriptor, based on the table from [TonyHax International](https://github.com/alex-free/tonyhax/blob/master/loader/gameid-psx-exe.c).

### `fmcb` handler
When the launcher receives `fmcb0:<idx>`, `fmcb1:<idx>` or `fmcb9:<idx>`  path as `argv[0]`, it reads `OSDMENU.CNF` from the respective memory card or the hard drive (`fmcb9`),
searches for `path?_OSDSYS_ITEM_<idx>` and `arg_OSDSYS_ITEM_<idx>` entries and attempts to launch the ELF.

Respects `cdrom_skip_ps2logo`, `cdrom_disable_gameid` and `cdrom_use_dkwdrv` for `cdrom` paths.

### Config handler
When the launcher receives a path that ends with `.CNF`, `.cnf`, `.CFG` or `.cfg`,
it will run the [quickboot handler](#quickboot-handler) using this file.

Config file can be located at any device as long as the device mountpoint is one of the listed above.

### Quickboot handler
When the launcher is started without any arguments, it tries to open `<ELF file name>.CNF`
file at the current working directory
and attempts to launch every path in order.

Quickboot file syntax example:
```ini
boot=boot.elf
path=mmce?:/apps/wle.elf
path=mmce?:/apps/wle2.elf
path=ata:/apps/wle.elf
path=mc?:/BOOT/BOOT.ELF
arg=-testarg
arg=-testarg2
```

`boot` — path relative to the config file  
`path` — absolute paths  
`arg` — arguments that will be passed to the ELF file 

## OSDMENU.CNF

Most of `OSDMENU.CNF` settings are directly compatible with those from FMCB 1.8 `FREEMCB.CNF`.

### Character limits

OSDMenu supports up to 250 custom menu entries, each up to 79 characters long.  
Note that left and right cursors are limited to 19 characters and top and bottom delimiters are limited to 79 characters.  
Launcher and DKWDRV paths are limited to 49 characters.
