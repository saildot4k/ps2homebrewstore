What is RETROLauncher?

RETROLauncher is a launcher with a graphical environment for retro games, 
created entirely in Lua under the Enceladus development environment, in 
conjunction with Retroarch, POPStarter, Neutrino and wLaunchELF ISR for the 
execution of the games/APPS.

The main objective of creating this program is to provide a friendly, 
attractive and customizable graphical environment to manage ROMS libraries 
on the PS2. In addition to being able to have all those libraries in one 
place and with easy access.

RETROLauncher seeks to avoid complex configurations, so the configurations 
are reduced to the minimum possible, just place the ROM and play, however, 
all the configurations are completely editable if an advanced user wishes 
to modify them, they are still there.

Special thanks to the entire "PSX-PLACE" community for providing support 
and visibility to the program. We also thank all the YouTube channels 
along with their communities for spreading and improving RETROLauncher 
with their messages of support and constructive feedback.

Spaghetticode: I created RETROLauncher with the sole purpose of having 
a simple and editable graphical environment to have collections of retro 
games on PS2, I made it for myself and I wasn't planning to publish it, 
but I thought it would be good to share it in case someone somewhere 
was looking for the same thing as me, something retro-focused on our 
beloved PS2. At no time did I want to offend or disrespect the developers 
behind the different applications used in this program, if I have done 
so I apologize. I tried to compile as much information as possible to 
give the credits correctly. I hope I haven't made a mistake, or that I've 
overlooked something. If so, I apologize. 

RETROLauncher we all do it.
 
Thank you for using RETROLauncher / Boon Tobias.
